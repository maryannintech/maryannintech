Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here's a little bit about me:

I'm currently relearning the basics of web development after taking a break. My passion lies in **creating meaningful projects** that not only challenge my skills but also align with my interests.

Right now, I'm focused on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, building small projects to strengthen my skills. I'm also currently learning React. I'm especially interested in growing my understanding of JavaScript and exploring more advanced topics with the goal of making a full-stack website.
