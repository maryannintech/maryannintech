# 🌊 Hi, I'm Mary Ann!

### Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here's a little bit about me:

* ⚓ I'm currently relearning the basics of web development after taking a break due to schooling and other priorities.
* 🐚 Right now, I'm focused on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, building small projects to strengthen my skills.
* 🌱 I'm especially interested in growing my understanding of JavaScript and exploring more advanced topics over time.
* 😄 Pronouns: She/Her.
* ⚡ Fun fact: I love movies and TV shows.

Thanks for stopping by! Don't forget to check out my repositories to see what I've been working on. If you have any questions or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out.
