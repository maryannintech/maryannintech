### Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here's a little bit about me:

* ⚓ i'm currently relearning the basics of web development after taking a break due to schooling and other priorities.
* 🐚 right now, i'm focused on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, building small projects to strengthen my skills.
* 🌱 i'm especially interested in growing my understanding of JavaScript and exploring more advanced topics over time.
