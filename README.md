# hi, i'm Mary Ann! üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏è

### Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here's a little bit about me:

* i'm currently relearning the basics of web development after taking a break due to schooling and other priorities.
* right now, i'm focused on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, building small projects to strengthen my skills.
* i'm especially interested in growing my understanding of JavaScript and exploring more advanced topics over time.
* pronouns: She/Her.

Thanks for stopping by! Don't forget to check out my repositories to see what I've been working on
